# PandasChallenge

This repository presents a Python pandas solution designed for analyzing school district data in the education sector. The objective of this project is to provide valuable insights to the school board and the mayor, assisting them in making informed decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities. The analysis involves two datasets in CSV format: the "schools_complete.csv" file, containing information such as Student ID, school name, type, size, and budget; and the "students_complete.csv" file, including details like Student ID, student name, gender, grade, school name, reading score, and math score. The project imports, merges, and aggregates data from both datasets into Python pandas dataframes for comprehensive analysis. The entire project is done in Jupyter Notebook.

The dataset comprises a total of 15 schools with 39,170 students. The average reading score for all students is 81.87, surpassing the average math score of 78.98. Notably, the passing rate for reading (85.80%) exceeds that of math (74.98%), resulting in an overall passing rate of 65.17%. These findings suggest a preference for reading over math among students.

Further analysis demonstartes that charter schools outperform district schools in average scores and passing rates. 

Surprisingly, as the budget per student increases, average scores and passing rates decrease. Larger schools tend to have lower average scores and passing rates.
